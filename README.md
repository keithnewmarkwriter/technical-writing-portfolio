# technical-writing-portfolio
A portfolio of my technical writing work

I'm Keith Newmark and I make complex things simple.

As a technical writer, my job is to bridge the gap between developers and users. This site is home to my technical portfolio, style guides, and documentation philosophy. However, I also believe that good writing comes from broad curiosity. Beyond the docs, you will find my personal musings on tools, techniques, trends, all all things technical and computer related.
